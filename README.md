# Automatic Number Plate Recognition (ANPR) using YOLOv7

## Introduction

Automatic Number Plate Recognition (ANPR) is a technology that uses optical character recognition on images to read vehicle registration plates. In this project, we aim to develop an ANPR system using YOLOv7, a state-of-the-art object detection model, to accurately detect and recognize license plates from images or videos.

## Objectives

1. Implement the YOLOv7 object detection model for ANPR.
2. Train the model on a dataset of vehicle images with annotated license plates.
3. Evaluate the model's performance in terms of detection accuracy and speed.
